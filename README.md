- Built my first PC in 8th grade, did some hacking in high school along with some gaming video production. Studied computer science in college and continued on to work in software marketing after graduation. Blockchain technology first peaked my interest in 2015-16 when Ethereum first started gaining traction. Later, I started crypto investing in about 2018. Since then I have engaged in numerous personal projects and experiments including, Helium mining, Solidity development, and working with Avax nodes to name a few.
